                <p>she is a first year student at san francisco state majoring in vis com design and bilingual journalism! she loves random fields of study. her six year old self with stanford med school dreams would be confused to say the least.  when it comes to design, some of her interests include 3d modeling, publication design, multimedia art (a big fav), and bad video making (ty old chunky family camcorder). </p>

                <p>outside of that, she also loves to explore new places, eat good food (she is celiac so it kinda makes you appreciate it even more), spend all her money on concerts, and spend time with those she loves!</p>

                <p>her family is from peru, but she was born in the bay and has lived in sunnyvale for most of her 19 years on this earth. her parents never let her or her siblings forget where they came from (and she is very grateful). her culture is - and will always be one of the most important pieces to her identity. and the food is yum. she hopes to go back and visit her extended family soon!
