                <p> vewn is an artist i've known and followed for a long time. i first saw their animations on youtube and i instantly loved their cartoony yet eerie style. my fav video of their's is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2D0AqrOICU"> <em>catscape </em> </a>. their style inspires me to doodle and overall puts me in a creative mood!</p>

                <p> tokidoki is a brand featuring art of so many different characters! it was created by artist simone legno. i love this art style ( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ ) my favorite characters are <a href="https://www.tokidoki.it/pages/til-death">adios and ciao ciao </a> (the grim reapers that are in love). some of my favorite aspects of this style is it's colors and playfulness. i feel like it evokes a sense of nostalgia that reminds me of my childhood and means a lot to me. </p>

                <p> sukipan is a artist and a <a href="https://sukinapan.itch.io/"> game dev </a> i came across on instagram! i love their work especially with 3d models. they do a lot of low poly designs which i find really appealing and nostalgic, they remind me of older animal crossing games. i have tried 3d modeling before and found it to be pretty difficult to get the hang of. but they are a big inspiration for me to keep practicing and to find my style! hopefully one day i can create even create silly a game!</p>
